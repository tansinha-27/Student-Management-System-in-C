# Student-Management-System-in-C
Created this for my first year project, purely using C. It uses the basic concepts of loops and file handling to store and access data, using a seperate text file.
It's features include:
1. Login system using a specific username and password
2. Updating and deletion of records
3. Finding a particular student record according to a certain parameter
4. Storing marks records and giving the highest and average accordingly
